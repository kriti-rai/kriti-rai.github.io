Just finished a chapter on web scraping and boy, was I lost...until I sat down to blog about it. So to agree with Avi (from the [video review](https://youtu.be/h2618jCo_eA) towards the end of OO), "stop plowing through the lessons". Instead, take a step back, revise, re-do the lab, ponder on it for a while. 

So I decided to follow the advice, take a moment, breathe, and jot down what I have understood. After rummaging through a couple of online sources and referencing back to the code-along lab in Learn, I sat down to implement the idea of data scraping to extract the list of top 100 songs from the [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100). So, bear with me as I walk you through my lengthy code-along.

But first, let's go over what the fuss is all about. Web scraping is a technique of extracting selective data out of the XML/HTML that makes up a webpage so you can use it in your program. If you've seen a page's HTML which you can simply do by right-clicking on the page and clicking on *page inspect* or *view page source*, you know that it has a whole lot of information and might even look gibberish to untrained eyes. To make sense of the gibberish and extract the information we are interested in is a meticulous task. So why go through all that pain? Well, you might be interested in some information from a webpage but it does not provide an API or RSS feed, making web scraping worth the pain.

So, let's start! Sure, there are different ways to do this but the method I use here references the one shown in codealong lab in Learn.  We are going to use a couple of Ruby gems -- *Open-uri* and *Nokogiri* to help us with scraping. Per [RubyDoc](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.3/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/OpenURI.html), *open-URI*  is an easy-to-use wrapper for Net::HTTP, Net::HTTPS and Net::FTP, whereas *Nokogiri* is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser. In other words, *Nokogiri* helps with scraping and parsing the HTML we import using *Open-uri*. *Open-uri* is a pretty standard gem and should already be available in Ruby. We can, however, install *Nokogiri* with the following command line in the terminal.

```
gem install nokogiri
```
Now, onto the coding!! Let's create a *Scraper.rb* file. On top of the page, we will *require* the aforementioned gems, alongside *pry* so you can play around with your code and see how it works. In our *Scraper.rb*, we will type:
```
require 'open-uri'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'pry'
```
Then, let's create a *Scraper* class and inside it create a local variable that equals to the data parsed out by the help of *Open-uri* and *Nokogiri*. 
```
class Scraper
    doc= Nokogiri::HTML(open('https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100'))
end
```
Now, if we run the file in the terminal, with the help of *pry* we will notice that *doc* equals to a bunch of data but if we look into it close enough we will notice that the data contains songs, artist and ranks and such -- the stuff we are interested in, and are wrapped up inside an array. So, how do we grab the elements? What is that one thing that goes hand-in-hand with XML/HTML to style elements.... that has selectors? 

**Insert CSS!! **

CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheet*. It has a whole bunch of selectors that wraps XML/HTML elements  in order to style them. So, with these selectors we could grab the elements we want from the page. Sweet! This part does require some knowledge of CSS. So given you have that, you can hover the cursor around the webpage while you are in the "inspecting" mode, to figure out the selectors you are interested in. Listed below are the selectors for the components we are interested in, like the song-title, its artist and the rank.

```
song_title: doc.css(".chart-row").first.css("h2").text
artist: doc.css(".chart-row").first.css(".chart-row__artist").text.strip
rank: doc.css(".chart-row").first.css(".chart-row__rank span.chart-row__current-week").text
```
This is not all of the code, but we will use it later so let's save it somewhere or simply comment it out. Heading back to our code file in *Scraper* class, let's create a few methods for each task we want the class to do -- initialize with a parsed XML/HTML (#initialize), get the song titles from the parsed doc (#get_songs), get the artists of the respective songs (#get_artists) and the songs' rankings (#get_ranks). And, this is where we will use the info we saved above.

```
class Scraper
  attr_accessor :doc
  def initialize
    @doc= Nokogiri::HTML(open('https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100'))
  end
  def get_songs
    @doc.css(".chart-row").css("h2").map {|song| song.text}
  end
  def get_artists
    @doc.css(".chart-row").css(".chart-row__artist").map {|artist| artist.text.strip}
  end
  def get_ranks
    @doc.css(".chart-row").css(".chart-row__rank span.chart-row__current-week").map {|rank| rank.text}
  end	
  scraper = Scraper.new
  songs = scraper.get_songs
  artists = scraper.get_artists
  ranks = scraper.get_ranks
  puts "THE BILLBOARD'S TOP 100 SONGS"
  (0..(ranks.size-1)).each_with_index do |index|
      puts "--- Number: #{index+1} ---"
      puts "#{songs[index].upcase} by #{artists[index]}"
  end
end
```
As you notice, we used the array#map method to iterate over the array returned by the parser to grab a value. Then, at the end, we simply created a new Scraper instance and assigned attributes to the instance to puts the intended data. Below is the output:
