I am not sure if anyone has heard of hi5, but it was huge back in the days (2003-ish) in Nepal. I'm assuming it was MySpace here in the U.S. Anyways, I vividly remember spending hours trying to style my profile so it would make me look "(extra)cool" to my friends. In doing so, there was a feature where you could change the font color, font styles, add images or gifs and change your backgrounds. The site would provide you with a bunch of gibberish which now I know was all CSS code. You would then would embed the code and, VOILA!!! your profile shone in all kinds of glory with those rampantly placed gifs and glowing hearts with a Greenday background that screamed "punk". And, I guess that was my first ever intro to CSS, well, and to social media.

It was only recently that I briefly learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, some of the widely used web development. tools, and how they work. "If HTML is the bones, CSS is the skin and JavaScript is the brains" stated the instructor at a local school where I attended a free intro to coding lesson. Although, I have heard that CSS has become more versatile and powerful now which I have yet to learn and discover. So far, I have completed few lessons in HTML and after tinkering with CSS a bit as advised in my last lab, I could tell that doing that in HTML would be repetitive and meticulous. So in that sense, CSS also saves us time and cuts down chances of errors. So, I would rephrase the instructors statement as "if HTML is the bones, CSS is the string that sows them together to perform collectively under a "nice/appealing" skin."
