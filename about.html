  Hi, I'm Kriti! Originally from Nepal and currently based in SF bay area, I come from a medical device background with a degree in Environmental Science and Chemistry.
  As the web is forever changing and almost ubiquitously used all around the world, I decided to dive into it in the hopes to learn
  something new and challenge myself. Eventually, my dream is to integrate this knowledge with my passion which is environmental conservation by
  helping people make a sound decision when it comes to activities that impact our planet's health. 
</p>
<p>
  I'm equally passionate about maintaining a healthy and active life but am guilty of indulging in burgers and fries and being a couch-potato every now and then. It's all about
  moderation, I believe. You will also find me trying my hand at photography (tsk! check out the background images here!), landscape and streets being my areas of interest...but that's
  a whole other story.
</p>
<p> Anyway, hear me rant here as I go on my coding adventure.</p>
