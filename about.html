    <p>Hey there! I'm Kriti (the human in the picture, not the dog!). Originally from Nepal and currently based in SF bay area, I come from a medical device background with a degree in Environmental Science and Chemistry.</p>
    <p>
      As the web is forever changing and almost ubiquitously used all around the world, I decided to enroll in FlatIron's online web development program hoping to learn
      something new and challenging. In so doing, I have found myself loving the process and the <strong>F</strong>r<strong>U</strong>stratio<strong>N</strong> that comes with problemsolving more and more.
      Now experienced in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript (React/Redux included), I eagerly look forward to learning other new languages (and things outside programming), building or helping build cool stuff and growing as a developer as well as a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not sitting in front of my computer working, you will often find me riding my bike around the town, working out, hiking if possible, indulging in landscape and street photography, and
      sketching or reading a book.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, hear me rant here as I go on my coding adventure.</p>
