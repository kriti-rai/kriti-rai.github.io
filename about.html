<p>Hi, I'm Kriti! Originally from Nepal and now based in SF bay area, I come from a medical device background with a degree in Environmental Science and Chemistry.
  As the web is forever changing and almost ubiquitously used all around the world, I decided to dive into it in the hopes to learn
  something new and challenge myself. Eventually, my dream is to integrate this knowledge with my passion which is environmental conservation.</p>
  <p> Hear me rant here as I go on my coding adventure.</p>
